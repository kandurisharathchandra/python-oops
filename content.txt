class and obj(example)
In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), 
a class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining their properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).
attributes are called by themselves and methods are called manually 
- why python is called oop?
    
    everything in python is an object (data structure,data type)
- Advantages of oops
    - we can create our own data type
    - code reusalbility
    - debugging
    - easy to colab
    
As python has everything in terms of class and object it is called object oriented programming language.
